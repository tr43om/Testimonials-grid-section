## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM notation
- SASS preprocessor
- Responsive units
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to use grids to built a responsive layout easily. And on the overall page layout but on a small components too. Like a user block:

```css
&__user {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: min-content max-content;
    grid-column-gap: 1rem;
}
```
Also I learned the mobile-first workflow and discovered for myself that it's more convinient and efficient way to write code, because this way I have way less lines of code in my scss files



### Continued development

I'm planning to build more complex and smart layouts using grid and all the advanced that I'm going to learn soon :)

## Acknowledgments

While doing this challenge, I realised the importance to keep practicing and implementing new skills and knowledge that I learned. Because If you just reading/watching and not doing you won't be able to build sites for yourself. It's like you watched a whole bunch of videous of how to ride a bycicle and then try to actually ride but you won's because you haven't practiced
